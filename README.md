=============================

Demo programs for React and Blaze from [Hype! React Conf talk from 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5e7kWSHWTg). Original source code is from [here](https://github.com/ryanflorence/reactconf-2015-HYPE) and [there](https://github.com/mitar/reactconf-2015-HYPE).

The right bottom widget shows rendering time in ms instead of memory usage.
